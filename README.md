# ps_i_love_git

Collection of my git notes I use in daily bases.
This repo can be used as a template for creating other repositories.

Other repo names I have considered:

1. the_practice_of_practice_git inspired by book "The Practice of Practice"
2. the_perfect_wrong_commit inspired by book "The Prefect Wrong Note"
3. git_player
4. git_forte
